# fluminus-mobile

Incomplete port of fluminus into Swift in the context of writing an iOS app.

Completely asynchronous API written on top of the Combine framework!

## Why I started
I started writing this to finally implement some kind of announcement push notification, with the iOS device acting like an ssh-agent, combined with a server written in Elixir using fluminus.
It was also out of excitement that Apple finally brought FRP into the fold.

Basically this whole repo is meant for me to learn how to use all the new features in iOS 13 that I never used before, such as SwiftUI, Combine, SwiftPM, etc.
Another project I did was printsoc, also unfinished.
It is meant to be a program to allow one to print documents to SoC printers.

## Why I stopped (for now)
I kinda lost interest since I won't be using the app anytime soon since I am on a semester leave from school (2019/2020 Semester 2).
I might continue it and buy an Apple dev account to work out the syncing part.
